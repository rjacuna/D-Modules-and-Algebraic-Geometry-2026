SIMIS visa letters: Contact Michael Fang (fangtianyue@simis.cn), CC your SIMIS host. Follow up directly if needed.

Connectivity (SIM cards)
A local Chinese SIM card (+86 number) is strongly recommended for SMS verification (ride-hailing, delivery, metro apps).

Where at PVG: China Telecom, T1 near Gate 11 (07:00–22:00). Passport required; English spoken.

International roaming: Works for basic data, not for local app SMS verifications.

Payments (Alipay/WeChat Pay—cashless daily life)
Set up in advance: Detailed guide at https://swoa2025.simis.cn/tips

ID verification: May require passport selfie in-app upon arrival in China.

Daily use: Apps’ QR codes accepted everywhere (restaurants, metro, convenience stores).

Navigation that actually works
Apple Maps: Reliable in China, but not from outside China.

Organic Maps: Excellent offline backup (works from outside China). Download Shanghai maps beforehand. Works from abroad as well.

Metro: 大都会 (DADUHUI) app or Alipay mini-program QR entry.

Ride-hailing (Didi)
Didi app: English available, accepts international numbers, built-in translation. Integrated with Alipay mini-app.

In-app Translation (WeChat & Alipay—highly recommended)
The built-in translation is extremely useful, as almost all daily tasks (restaurant menus, metro tickets, directions, etc.) rely on these mega-apps.

WeChat: Enable via Me → Settings → General → Translation.

Alipay: International version includes integrated translation tools.

Power, Time & Weather Essentials
Electricity: 220 V. Sockets accept US/EU two-pin plugs; slim adapter recommended for grounded plugs.

Time zone: UTC+8 (no daylight saving).

Weather: average is 8–18°C, but could be extreme for -1-33°C according the history data of recent 3 years.

Emergencies: Police 110 • Fire 119 • Ambulance 120
