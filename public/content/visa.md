# Visa-Free Access to China
Currently, there are two ways that you can enter China without a visa:

1. 240-Hour Visa-free Transit Policy

The National Immigration Administration (NIA) announced that it will fully relax and optimize the visa-free transit policy, which is effective immediately. The stay duration for foreign nationals eligible for visa-free transit has been extended from the previous 72 hours and 144 hours to 240 hours (10 days). Additionally, 21 ports of entry and exit have been added for visa-free transit individuals, further expanding the allowed areas for visa-free transit travelers. Individuals from 54 eligible countries, including Russia, Brazil, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Canada, traveling from China to a third country (region), can enter visa-free through any of the 60 open ports in 24 provinces, and stay within the allowed areas for visa-free transit travelers for no more than 240 hours.

Simply speaking, for the citizens from 54 countries mentioned in the policy, if he/she has an air ticket to a third country/region(key point), he/she is eligible for the current China’s Visa-free Transit Policy ( up to 240 hours ).
